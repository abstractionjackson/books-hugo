* Notes
** Lewsian Character
- Locked-in: constantly working from dawn till day's end, like
  J.S. Bach.
- Bigoted: anti-Catholic since childhood, and he never shook it
- "portly"
- A "life of the party" figure
- Outspoken (to state the obvious)
- A legit English poet
** Noteworthy Books About Lewis
- /C.S. Lewis: The Shape of His Faith/
** Works of Interest
- /The Chronicles of Narnia/
- /Till We Have Faces/
  - Seems like his /Finnegan's Wake/
- /Mere Christianity/
** Biographical Tidbits
- T.S. Eliot and Lewis met, and bristled at one another, but kept in
  touch, and -- eventually - became good friends.
